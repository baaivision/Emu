- [**Emu1**](Emu1) (ICLR 2024, 2023/07) - Generative Pretraining in Multimodality

- [**Emu2**](Emu2) (CVPR 2024, 2023/12) - Generative Multimodal Models are In-Context Learners

- [**Emu3**](https://github.com/baaivision/Emu3) (arXiv 2024, 2024/09) - Next-Token Prediction is All You Need 🔥🔥🔥

## News
- 2024.9 We introduce **Emu3**, a new suite of state-of-the-art multimodal models trained solely with next-token prediction. 🔥🔥🔥
- 2024.2 **Emu1 and Emu2 are accepted by ICLR 2024 and CVPR 2024 respectively! 🎉**
- 2023.12 Inference code, model and demo of Emu2 are available. Enjoy the [demo](http://218.91.113.230:9002/).
- 2023.12 We have released Emu2, open and largest generative multimodal models that achieve new state of the art on multimodal understanding and generation tasks.
- 2023.7 Inference code and model of Emu are available.
- 2023.7 We have released Emu, a multimodal generalist that can seamlessly generate images and texts in multimodal context.


## Hightlights
- State-of-the-art performance
- Next-generation capabilities
- A base model for diverse tasks

We hope to foster the growth of our community through open-sourcing and promoting collaboration👬. Let's step towards multimodal intelligence together🍻.
